**HTTPS Development Setup**

If you want to get rid of the "Your connection is not private" in browser message...

The application uses Caddy as a reverse proxy to enable HTTP/2 support. When you first access https://localhost:3000, you might see a certificate warning. To fix this:

1. Start the Docker services: `yarn docker.up`
2. Extract Caddy's root certificate:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec caddy cat /data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt > caddy_root.crt
   ```
3. Add it to your system's trust store:

   - **macOS**:
     ```bash
     sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain caddy_root.crt
     ```
   - **Linux**:
     ```bash
     sudo cp caddy_root.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
     sudo update-ca-certificates
     ```
   - **Windows**: Double-click the certificate file and install it to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"

4. Restart your browser

Note: The certificate is specific to your machine and is automatically generated by Caddy. Never commit the `caddy_root.crt` file to version control.
